# Multi-Step Form - Design Decisions 🎨

## 🎯 Objectives

The goal of this project was to create a **dynamic multi-step form** with a modern UI, error validation, and state management.

## 📌 Design Choices

### 1️⃣ **UI/UX Design**

- Used **Flexbox & Grid** for a **responsive** layout.
- Applied a **gradient background** for a professional look.
- Used **animations & transitions** for a smooth experience.

### 2️⃣ **Form State Management**

- Implemented **JavaScript objects** to store form data.
- Used **localStorage** to allow users to resume progress after a refresh.

### 3️⃣ **Validation & Error Handling**

- Ensured **real-time validation** (Email must end in `@gmail.com`, Phone must be 10 digits).
- Highlighted errors with **user-friendly messages**.

### 4️⃣ **Scalability & Future Enhancements**

To make this form **production-ready**, we can:

- 🔹 **Connect it to a backend** (Node.js/Express) to store user submissions.
- 🔹 Use **React.js** for better state management.
- 🔹 Add **custom form components** for reusability.
